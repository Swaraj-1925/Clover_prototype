**Clover: A Music App Born Out of Boredom**  
---

Clover is a project I started because I was bored and tired of my Spotify experience. I’d open the app to play music, only to be hit with a “New Release” banner for an artist I don’t even listen to. Then I noticed Spotify’s algorithm kept suggesting music in a way that felt too rigid—like it was stuck on one genre, which didn’t work for me. I wanted something different.

So, Clover suggests music based on what others enjoy, combined with how you interact with songs. It tracks stuff like how long you listen to a track and the order of your playlist. If you skip a song before it’s done, Clover assumes it’s not a great fit after the previous track and leans toward the next one instead. This makes the algorithm a bit unique—it’s less about locking you into one style and more about mixing things up based on patterns. It’s handy if you don’t always want the same kind of music or just like variety.

Clover also pulls in your friends’ tastes. If you and a friend have, say, 60-70% similar music preferences, it looks at what they listen to after a song and factors that into your queue. Your own preferences get the most weight, followed by your friend’s, and then global trends. It also keeps tabs on your favorite artists for updates—no sponsored ads, even with a premium account. On the tech side, Clover uses Spotify’s music data because, well, I’m not exactly in the budget to buy a music label.

**About the Attached Media**  
The images and videos here are from the [bottomSheet](https://github.com/Swaraj-1925/Clover_prototype/tree/bottomSheet) . A few features are still in progress—I worked on this for about three months before I lost steam. I’ve moved to a new [repo](https://github.com/Swaraj-1925/Clover) with a Python FastAPI backend and Kotlin for the Android logic, but it’s taking longer than expected. It might be a few months before it’s fully done, so it’s a slow work in progress.
